## Description & Options
By default, this mod acts on two areas, natural decay that happens over time, and tool degradation that happens with each use. In the default cases, the modifier set by Global Decay and Global On Use Decay will be what's used on each instance.
If you want more granular control, you can turn on the advanced options, which will show more sliders for specific types of items.
Also, with Food Decay, you can also turn on advanced settings, so you can control the decay rates for cooked/raw meat, and opened/unopened packaged food.
There's also a control to set at what rate items will decay until the player finds them. This modifier is layered with the other ones, so the rate stacks. For example, if you set food decay to 0.5, and before pickup decay to 0.5, until you find the food item, it will decay at 0.25 rate.
